# IoT-DemoJam_SmartGateway
Internet of Things DemoJam :: Smart Gateway

---
This is almost a direct fork of [PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Gateway](https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Gateway)  
But I have already forked that repository for my original demo.  
Contains additions for:  
- DockerFile changes to run on a Raspberry Pi / ARM chip,  
- a variable password,  
- and IP changes for this DemoJam environment.

##Notes:
Check out these 2 other read me's:  
A great overview of the project from Patrick Steiner [here](https://github.com/MichaelFitzurka/IoT_Demo_Gateway/blob/master/Readme.adoc)  
And a "from scratch" install instruction set for the Raspberry Pi [here](https://github.com/MichaelFitzurka/IoT-DemoJam_SmartGateway/blob/master/README-Raspberry_Pi.md)
